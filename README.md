This is a command-line farkle simulator. You can play with as many players as you like (even one for you loners).
In order to play farkle run 'ruby farkle.rb' from inside the project directory.
If you are unfamiliar with farkle, run 'ruby tutorial.rb' to follow through an interactive tutorial.
Thanks for playing and I hope you enjoy!
